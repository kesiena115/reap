Innovation is the name of the game for New Zealand. Kiwi companies are working hard to be smart, think sharper and get to market faster. New Zealanders are an ingenious people. We have a strong heritage of developing great ideas borne out of practical neccessity, or inspired brilliance, or simply an instinct of what might work. Like other governments around the world, the New Zealand government continues to signal the importance it places on science and innovation as a key driver of our economic wellbeing. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) Science and Innovation Group has been charged with lifting our economic, environmental and social performance by driving the science and innovation sector. We do this through our strategic leadership and through the networks we build across government, research organisations, business and industry. MBIE is committed to growing the number of driven, successful entrepreneurs who are willing to help grow the innocation ecosystem in New Zealand. We support a number of programmes and initiatives that all contribute to this goal. We are partnering with people and organisations across the ecosystem to drive the growth of highly-skilled entrepreneurs.

                      Developed by REAP faculty and scholars, the REAP index aims to overcome three challenges when assessing regional entrepreneurial performance. First, recognizing that firms matter in very different degrees, but that nonetheless each should be taken into account, the REAP index estimates the quality of firms and then develops aggregate statistics that weight different firms by their quality. Second, by using a quality-based approach, the REAP index methodology is able to incorporate all firms in the economy, <input id="more-reap-index-btn" class="btn btn-default dashboard-sm-btn" type="button" value="read more"><span class="more-reap-index-description">and builds on a unique feature of the entrepreneurial process to anchor the data on which the index is built: registering a firm is an early and practical requirement for growth. And third, by having an estimate for each firm, in each cohort and address, the REAP index allows practitioners to dial into specific sub-regions, industry groups, or cohorts, to understand the distribution of entrepreneurial quality and quantity across the region geography and time. </span>

                    <p class="more-reap-index-description">
                      The REAP index is built through a predictive model, calibrated at MIT, that uses business registration records to find features of firms at founding. These features include industry, founding team characteristics, corporate form, firm name, and intellectual property. We then provide different weights for each of these features to create a firm-level score, which we then aggregate across geography and time.This new approach offers practitioners a unique way to analyze, benchmark, and track IDE performance in their ecosystem. <input id="less-reap-index-btn" class="btn btn-default dashboard-sm-btn" type="button" value="show less">
