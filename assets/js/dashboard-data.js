Lauri joined the Finnish REAP team representing Aaltoes (Aalto Entrepreneurship Society), a student-run organization that was kicked-off in 2010 by students of Aalto University. Aaltoes is driving a positive cultural change in Finland so that academic students and researcher alike would start new businesses and write their own growth stories. The vision of the society is to turn Finland and the nearby area (Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Baltics and Stockholm) into one of the next entrepreneurship hubs by 2025. According to Lauri there is still a long way go but there is a simple formula that helps in reaching that goal: determination, hard work, the help of experienced entrepreneurs and not being afraid of trying out new things. Currently Lauri works with the most promising Finnish startup and growth companies at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Finland. The Economist (2013): &amp;#39;IN 2010 A GROUP of students at Aalto University, just outside Helsinki, embarked on the most constructive piece of student activism in the history of the genre.

Innovation is the name of the game for New Zealand. Kiwi companies are working hard to be smart, think sharper and get to market faster. New Zealanders are an ingenious people. We have a strong heritage of developing great ideas borne out of practical neccessity, or inspired brilliance, or simply an instinct of what might work. Like other governments around the world, the New Zealand government continues to signal the importance it places on science and innovation as a key driver of our economic wellbeing. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) Science and Innovation Group has been charged with lifting our economic, environmental and social performance by driving the science and innovation sector. We do this through our strategic leadership and through the networks we build across government, research organisations, business and industry. MBIE is committed to growing the number of driven, successful entrepreneurs who are willing to help grow the innocation ecosystem in New Zealand. We support a number of programmes and initiatives that all contribute to this goal. We are partnering with people and organisations across the ecosystem to drive the growth of highly-skilled entrepreneurs.",

Upon graduating in 1998, he joined Unilever and held several positions there. After Unilever, he worked at Savola, a large Saudi Arabian edible oil company, first as a Sales Director and later as Deputy General Manager. During his time at both companies, Youssef deepened his knowledge of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution channels and honed his logistics and sales skills.</p><p></p><p>Youssef left Savola in 2008 to become a social entrepreneur. Concerned by the triple financial, food, and oil crises, he was drawn to second generation biofuel made from waste, rather than food products, which encouraged sustainable waste disposal and reduced pressure on food production. In early 2008, Youssef climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and relished the triumph of persevering through doubt and difficulties. He soon founded Kilimanjaro Environment, hoping the name would carry over similar notions of commitment and drive. He immediately began collecting UCO for biodiesel producers, which he financed through freelance consulting on FMCG distribution, marketing, and sales. After several months, Youssef sold his first shipment of UCO to Italian company Projet Energy and struck up a strategic partnership early the next year with petrochemical aggregator AOT trading, a Swiss subsidiary of Astra Transcor Energy. This relationship quickly evolved and helped the company triple revenue in the first year alone.</p><p></p><p>Kilimanjaro Environment is at the forefront of the green energy movement in Morocco. The company collects used cooking oil from restaurants and hotels, which it filters, treats, and resells to biodiesel manufacturers. It also resells fatty acid products to both biodiesel and feedstock production plants. Having recently launched a pilot biodiesel production plant, Kilimanjaro now also produces biodiesel in house. The company's process not only eliminates and treats waste, but also helps reduce CO2 emissions and find new ways to create clean energy.</p>"

GDP per capita in the region was &euro;20.073 and in Spain was &euro;22.780.\rThe unemployment rate was over 24% in March 2015, and even greater among women. The typical Valencian business is a small-to-medium-sized company, mainly family-owned and operated, although there are some multinationals.\rIn addition to tourism, the Valencia Region has significant exports, and it ranks second in this topic among the Spanish autonomous communities, constituting 12% of the national total. Major exports include agricultural products, ceramic tiles, marble products and cars (Ford has an assembly line in Almussafes), which make the port of Valencia one the busiest in Europe.",
