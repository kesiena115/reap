Team member,,,Lauri Lehtovuori,"Manager, Markets at PwC. Lauri joined the Finnish REAP team representing Aaltoes (Aalto Entrepreneurship Society), a student-run organization that was kicked-off in 2010 by students of Aalto University. Aaltoes is driving a positive cultural change in Finland so that academic students and researcher alike would start new businesses and write their own growth stories. The vision of the society is to turn Finland and the nearby area (Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Baltics and Stockholm) into one of the next entrepreneurship hubs by 2025. According to Lauri there is still a long way go but there is a simple formula that helps in reaching that goal: determination, hard work, the help of experienced entrepreneurs and not being afraid of trying out new things. Currently Lauri works with the most promising Finnish startup and growth companies at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Finland. The Economist (2013): &#39;IN 2010 A GROUP of students at Aalto University, just outside Helsinki, embarked on the most constructive piece of student activism in the history of the genre. They had been converted to the power of entrepreneurialism during a visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&#39;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
