Region Description,Description of Current Regional Entrepreneurial Ecosystem,,"Valencia Region is an autonomous community of Spain and is located in the Middle East of the country. It is the fourth most populated region after Andalusia, Catalonia and Madrid with more than 5.1 million inhabitants.As in all Spain, there was a significant economic growth in the years immediately following 2004, until the Spanish financial crisis. In 2014, the Valencia Country generated 9.39% of the Spanish GDP. The GDP of the Valencia Region in 2014 was 99.345 millions of euros, and the total GDP of Spain was 1.058.469 millions of euros. GDP per capita in the region was &euro;20.073 and in Spain was &euro;22.780.The unemployment rate was over 24% in March 2015, and even greater among women. The typical Valencian business is a small-to-medium-sized company, mainly family-owned and operated, although there are some multinationals.In addition to tourism, the Valencia Region has significant exports, and it ranks second in this topic among the Spanish autonomous communities, constituting 12% of the national total. Major exports include agricultural products, ceramic tiles, marble products and cars (Ford has an assembly line in Almussafes), which make the port of Valencia one the busiest in Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
